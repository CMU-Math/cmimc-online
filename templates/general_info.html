                            <p>
                                The AI round is a round robin programming challenge where you and your team will have 2 hours to write AI’s for 6 mini games that we have created. Every 5 minutes, we will take your most recent submission and play that AI against every other team’s AI’s on a live leaderboard where your score is based on how well you are doing in each game. An example of a game may be [insert game we are not using]. All code should be written in python3. This is a 2 hour round.

                        <p>
                            In this round, you and your team will focus on 3 optimization/approximation based problems.
                            These are problems that often appear in real world engineering situations or just in math contests where the precise or optimal answer can’t be determined. These problems have a very mathy flair, but need some computational tools and thinking to get an answer. You will have a variety of test cases for each problem, and you can even write custom code for each test case. Scores will be displayed on a leaderboard where your score will be your best performing submission. Your code can be written in any language as you are just submitting a text output.
                            This is a 3 hour round.
