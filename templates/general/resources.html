        <h2>Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
        <p>CMIMC is committed to inclusivity and increasing the diversity of our competition. We recognize that math competitions lack in both of these regards and thus we will constantly make an active effort to bring out resources in order to help increase accessibility. Below you will find these resources but please note that you can also reach out to us directly to best fit your needs.</p>

        <p>Everyone should feel welcome to participate and contribute to CMIMC. CMIMC is committed to fostering an environment centered around encouraging new ideas and viewpoints regardless of background. We value perspectives from all backgrounds and experiences and hope that everyone embraces our diversity. Actions infringing on these beliefs will not be tolerated.</p>
